Class for ReadCSV info taken here:

I included boost to make the split of the lines easier using "boost::algorithm:split() function.
    e.g.: "boost::algorithm::split(vec, line, boost::is_any_of(delimeter))"
    To compile it you need to have Boost Library installed.
        On Debian based systems: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
